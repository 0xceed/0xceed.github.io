My name is Alexander, but I prefer **0xceed**. I like well-built things. And like to build them, too.

iOS engineer since 2010, previously freelancing for Windows Mobile. I use Swift, but really love C and Rust. A little into embedded and hardware design.

Besides coding, I am into fast-paced shooters, deep single player games, photography and music. And this blog, hopefully.

Since middle of 2025 working on [Discrete](https://discrete.app) â€” native iOS / macOS music player for Jellyfin.
