It so happened that the past year was full of beginnings. Wishing not to slow down, I start this one in similar way, and this blog — one of first notorious events. Quite natural would be to write here about my frustration when I deal with new things.

As far as I remember, general factors for me always have been fear that I would fail and my own expectations. While last one might be different perk under different circumstances, the fear is extremely dangerous in different life aspects. For some reason, I implicitly treated mistakes and "wasted" time as an anomaly, something I should avoid. In reality, failure, unlike success, benefits more, when accepted and reasons understood. Such an understanding is essentially life experience which will allow one to success in the future.

Mistakes — completely normal and natural adventure on any way. Chipping in on anything one like and are interested in, failing and ending up without any success at all — is the right way. Truly wasted time — the one which gone away without even failure, just because of fear that this outcome is possible.

The fear of failure and inaction — that is real problem. Sure, there are a lot more of them, but that is fundamental one and most destructive.

>To be loser is way more easier, than to be considered one.

Here and now I'm intended to run this blog just as collection of my notes, maybe some stories and thoughts about everything happening to me.

There are some things I'd like to write about — mainly for the history, for me. Nonetheless, I'll try to make them public, creating some feeling inside me that these post might be read by someone else. Thus I hope to learn to express my thoughts and feelings, improve my English, and become more proficient in shaping ideas into something understandable by another human beings, besides me. Inner monologue is always completely obvious for us, so not publishing my texts is basically just transferring it to some medium.

That is bad text. I know. I will make a lot more bad texts, I might be considered horrible graphomaniac, I might never ever become at least mediocre writer, but today I start.

Interestingly, this note originally dated 22 February, 2021. A lot has happened due today, and thus I'm even more excited to start this blog already. Let's see.
